Qri Datasets are versioned using a process similar to that of git.  A user can make changes to a working copy of a datasetâ€™s components, and commit those changes once an important milestone is reached. A commit creates a new version of the dataset which is immutable, timestamped, and identified by a hash.

A datasetâ€™s components are always connected and are versioned together, meaning changes to any individual component will result in a new version of the dataset.

Each version is signed using keypair cryptology so others can verify that a specific user is responsible for a given version.


Using a `username/datasetname` reference on its own always refers to the _latest version_ of a dataset.  Older versions can be referenced by adding the ipfs hash to the base reference in the format of {peername}/{dataset name}@{network}/{hash}
