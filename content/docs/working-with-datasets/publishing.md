_Publishing_ a qri dataset from your local machine makes use of Qri Cloud, our global platform for finding and sharing datasets.  Publishing does a couple of things:

- Copies the bytes for a dataset to Qri Cloud, effectively backing up and serving the dataset on the Qri network
- Creates a _dataset preview_ page on qri.cloud/{username}/{datasetname}, where other users can preview the dataset before downloading it

## Publishing in Qri Desktop

## Publishing in Qri Cloud

<InfoBlock type='warning'>
  Qri Cloud is currently in alpha status and is experimental.  All data on Qri Cloud is public. Be careful when publishing your datasets.
