_Publishing_ a qri dataset from your local machine makes use of Qri Cloud, our global platform for finding and sharing datasets.  Publishing does a couple of things:

- Copies the bytes for a dataset to Qri Cloud, effectively backing up and serving the dataset on the Qri network
- Creates a _dataset preview_ page on qri.cloud/{username}/{datasetname}, where other users can preview the dataset before downloading it

## Publishing in Qri Desktop

## Publishing in Qri CLI

Use the command `qri publish` to publish the latest version of a dataset.

```
$ qri publish foo/simple_csv
published dataset foo/simple_csv@/ipfs/Qme1KedPB7assGKfznH5jQb1vGsZyNkcwVkkGpuhrq2XYp

```

<InfoBlock type='warning'>
  Qri Cloud is currently in alpha status and is experimental.  All data on Qri Cloud is public. Be careful when publishing your datasets.
