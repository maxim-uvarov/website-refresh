## qri add

Add a dataset from another peer

#### Synopsis


Add retrieves a dataset owned by another peer and adds it to your repo.
The dataset reference of the dataset will remain the same, including
the name of the peer that originally added the dataset. You must have
`qri connect` running in another terminal to use this command.

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
-->
```
qri add [flags]
```

#### Examples

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
# TODO(dlong): Mock `add` so that it doesn't require external resources,
# to test the syntax of this command.
-->
```
  # add a dataset named their_data, owned by other_peer:
  $ qri add other_peer/their_data
```

#### Options

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
# TODO(dlong): Automatically compare against real command-line flags
-->
```
  -h, --help   help for add
```



________



## qri config get

get configuration settings

#### Synopsis

get outputs your current configuration file with private keys
removed by default, making it easier to share your qri configuration settings.

You can get particular parts of the config by using dot notation to
traverse the config object. For details on each config field checkout:
https://github.com/qri-io/qri/blob/master/config/readme.md

The --with-private-keys option will show private keys.
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE NEVER SHARE YOUR PRIVATE KEYS WITH ANYONE. EVER.
Anyone with your private keys can impersonate you on qri.

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
-->
```
qri config get [flags]
```

#### Examples

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
# TODO(dlong): Fix this stub.
-->
```
  # get the entire config
  qri config get

  # get the config profile
  qri config get profile

  # get the profile description
  qri config get profile.description
```

#### Options

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
# TODO(dlong): Automatically compare against real command-line flags

```
  -c, --concise             print output without indentation, only applies to json format
  -f, --format string       data format to export. either json or yaml (default "yaml")
  -h, --help                help for get
  -o, --output string       path to export to
      --with-private-keys   include private keys in export
```



________


## qri config set

Set configuration options

#### Synopsis

'qri config set' allows you to set configuration options. You can set
particular parts of the config by using dot notation to traverse the
config object.

While the 'qri config get' command allows you to view the whole config,
or only parts of it, the 'qri config set' command is more specific.

If the config object were a tree and each field a branch, you can only
set the leaves of the branches. In other words, the you cannot set a
field that is itself an object or array. For details on each config
field checkout: https://github.com/qri-io/qri/blob/master/config/readme.md

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
-->
```
qri config set [flags]
```

#### Examples

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
# TODO(dlong): Fix this stub.
-->
```
  # set a profile description
  qri config set profile.description "This is my new description that I
  am very proud of and want displayed in my profile"

  # disable rpc communication
  qri config set rpc.enabled false
```

#### Options

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
# TODO(dlong): Automatically compare against real command-line flags
-->
```
  -h, --help   help for set
```



________


## qri config

Get and set local configuration information

#### Synopsis


'qri config' encapsulates all settings that control the behaviour of qri.
This includes all kinds of stuff: your profile details; enabling & disabling
different services; what kind of output qri logs to;
which ports on qri serves on; etc.

Configuration is stored as a .yaml file kept at $QRI_PATH, or provided at CLI
runtime via command a line argument.

For details on each config field checkout:
https://github.com/qri-io/qri/blob/master/config/readme.md

#### Examples

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
# TODO(dlong): Fix this stub.
-->
```
  # get your profile information
  $ qri config get profile

  # set your api port to 4444
  $ qri config set api.port 4444

  # disable rpc connections:
  $ qri config set rpc.enabled false
```

#### Options

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
# TODO(dlong): Automatically compare against real command-line flags
-->
```
  -h, --help   help for config
```



________


## qri connect

Connect to the distributed web by spinning up a Qri node

#### Synopsis


While it’s not totally accurate, connect is like starting a server. Running
connect will start a process and stay there until you exit the process
(ctrl+c from the terminal, or killing the process using tools like activity
monitor on the mac, or the aptly-named “kill” command). Connect does three main
things:
- Connect to the qri distributed network
- Connect to IPFS
- Start a local API server

When you run connect you are connecting to the distributed web, interacting with
peers & swapping data.

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
-->
```
qri connect [flags]
```

#### Options

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
# TODO(dlong): Automatically compare against real command-line flags
-->
```
      --api-port int           port to start api on
      --disable-api            disables api, overrides the api-port flag
      --disable-p2p            disables webapp, overrides the webapp-port flag
      --disable-rpc            disables rpc, overrides the rpc-port flag
      --disable-webapp         disables webapp, overrides the webapp-port flag
      --disconnect-after int   duration to keep connected in seconds, 0 means run indefinitely
  -h, --help                   help for connect
      --read-only              run qri in read-only mode, limits the api endpoints
      --registry string        specify registry to setup with. only works when --setup is true
      --rpc-port int           port to start rpc listener on
      --setup                  run setup if necessary, reading options from environment variables
      --webapp-port int        port to serve webapp on
```



________


## qri diff

Compare differences between two datasets

#### Synopsis


Diff compares two datasets from your repo and prints a representation
of the differences between them.  You can specifify the datasets
either by name or by their hash. You can compare different versions of
the same dataset.

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
-->
```
qri diff [flags]
```

#### Examples

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
# TODO(dlong): Configure this instance to have a mock ipfs repo with these hashes
-->
```
  # show diff between two versions of the same dataset:
  $ qri diff me/annual_pop@/ipfs/QmcBZoEQ7ot4UYKn1JM3gwd4LHorj6FJ4Ep19rfLBT3VZ8 \
  me/annual_pop@/ipfs/QmVvqsge5wqp4piJbLArwVB6iJSTrdM8ZRpHY7fikASrr8

  # show diff between two different datasets:
  $ qri diff me/population_2016 me/population_2017
```

#### Options

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
# TODO(dlong): Automatically compare against real command-line flags
-->
```
  -d, --display string   set display format [reg|short|delta|detail]
  -h, --help             help for diff
```



________


## qri export

Copy datasets to your local filesystem

#### Synopsis


Export gets datasets out of qri. By default it exports the dataset body, as `body.csv`, header as`dataset.json`, and ref, as `ref.txt` files.

To export to a specific directory, use the --output flag.

If you want an empty dataset that can be filled in with details to create a
new dataset, use --blank.

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
-->
```
qri export [flags]
```

#### Examples

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
# TODO(dlong): This is totally out of date.
-->
```
  # export dataset
  qri export me/annual_pop

  # export without the body of the dataset
  qri export --no-body me/annual_pop

  # export to a specific directory
  qri export -o ~/new_directory me/annual_pop
```

#### Options

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
# TODO(dlong): This is totally out of date.
-->
```
      --blank                export a blank dataset YAML file, overrides all other flags except output
      --body-format string   format for dataset body. default is the original data format. options: json, csv, cbor
  -f, --format string        format for all exported files, except for body. yaml is the default format. options: yaml, json (default "yaml")
  -h, --help                 help for export
  -b, --no-body              don't include dataset body in export
  -o, --output string        path to write to, default is current directory
  -d, --peer-dir             export to a peer name namespaced directory
```



________


## qri get

Get elements of qri datasets

#### Synopsis

Get the qri dataset (except for the body). You can also get portions of
the dataset: meta, structure, viz, transform, and commit. To narrow down
further to specific fields in each section, use dot notation. The get
command prints to the console in yaml format, by default.

You can get pertinent information on multiple datasets at the same time
by supplying more than one dataset reference.

Check out https://qri.io/docs/reference/dataset/ to learn about each section of the
dataset and its fields.

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
-->
```
qri get [flags]
```

#### Examples

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
-->
```
  # print the entire dataset to the console
  qri get me/annual_pop

  # print the meta to the console
  qri get meta me/annual_pop

  # print the dataset body size to the console
  qri get structure.length me/annual_pop

  # print the dataset body size for two different datasets
  qri get structure.length me/annual_pop me/annual_gdp

  # print the body itself for the dataset
  qri get body me/annual_pop
```

#### Options

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
# TODO(dlong): Automatically compare against real command-line flags
-->
```
      --concise         print output without indentation, only applies to json format
  -f, --format string   set output format [json, yaml] (default "yaml")
  -h, --help            help for get
```



________


## qri list

Show a list of datasets

#### Synopsis


List shows lists of datasets, including names and current hashes.

The default list is the latest version of all datasets you have on your local
qri repository.

When used in conjunction with `qri connect`, list can list a peer's dataset. You
must have `qri connect` running in a separate terminal window.

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
-->
```
qri list [flags]
```

#### Examples

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
# TODO(dlong): Add mock connection to test looking up peer datasets
-->
```
  # show all of your datasets:
  qri list

  # show your datasets that have "tax" in the name
  qri list tax

  # to view the list of your peer's dataset,
  # in one terminal window:
  qri connect

  # in a separate terminal window, to show all of b5's datasets:
  qri list --peer b5
```

#### Options

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
# TODO(dlong): Automatically compare against real command-line flags
-->
```
  -f, --format string   set output format [json]
  -h, --help            help for list
  -l, --limit int       limit results, default 25 (default 25)
  -o, --offset int      offset results, default 0
  -p, --published       list only published datasets
```



________


## qri log

Show log of dataset history

#### Synopsis


`qri log` prints a list of changes to a dataset over time. Each entry in the log is a
snapshot of a dataset taken at the moment it was saved that keeps exact details
about how that dataset looked at at that point in time.

We call these snapshots versions. Each version has an author (the peer that
created the version) and a message explaining what changed. Log prints these
details in order of occurrence, starting with the most recent known version,
working backwards in time.

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
-->
```
qri log [flags]
```

#### Examples

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
# TODO(dlong): Fix this stub.
-->
```
  show log for the dataset b5/precip:
  $ qri log b5/precip
```

#### Options

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
# TODO(dlong): Automatically compare against real command-line flags
-->
```
  -h, --help         help for log
  -l, --limit int    limit results, default 25 (default 25)
  -o, --offset int   offset results, default 0
```



________


## qri peers connect

Connect to a peer

#### Synopsis


Connect to a peer using a peername, peer ID, or multiaddress. Qri will use this name, id, or address
to find a peer to which it has not automatically connected.

You must have a Qri node running (`qri connect`) in a separate terminal. You will only be able
to connect to a peer that also has spun up it's own Qri node.

A multiaddress, or multiaddr, is the most specific way to refer to a peer's location, and is therefore
the most sure-fire way to connect to a peer.

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
-->
```
qri peers connect [flags]
```

#### Examples

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
# TODO(dlong): Add mock peers with given address, to test peer connection
-->
```
  # spin up a Qri node
  qri connect

  # in a separate terminal, connect to a specific peer
  qri peers connect /ip4/192.168.0.194/tcp/4001/ipfs/QmUNLLsPACCz1vLxQVkXqqLX5R1X345qqfHbsf67hvA3Nn
```

#### Options

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
# TODO(dlong): Automatically compare against real command-line flags
-->
```
  -h, --help   help for connect
```



________


## qri peers disconnect

Explicitly close a connection to a peer

#### Synopsis


Explicitly close a connection to a peer using a peername, peer id, or multiaddress.

You can close all connections to the Qri network by ending your Qri node session.

Use the disconnect command when you want to stay connected to the network, but want to
close your connection to a specific peer. This could be because that connection is hung,
the connection is pulling too many resources, or because you simply no longer need an
explicit connection.  This is not the same as blocking a peer or connection.

Once you close a connection to a peer, you or that peer can immediately open another
connection.

You must have `qri connect` running in another terminal.

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
-->
```
qri peers disconnect [flags]
```

#### Examples

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
# TODO(dlong): Fix this stub.
-->
```
  # disconnect from a peer using a multiaddr
  qri peers disconnect /ip4/192.168.0.194/tcp/4001/ipfs/QmUNLLsPACCz1vLxQVkXqqLX5R1X345qqfHbsf67hvA3Nn
```

#### Options

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
# TODO(dlong): Automatically compare against real command-line flags
-->
```
  -h, --help   help for disconnect
```



________


## qri peers info

Get info on a Qri peer

#### Synopsis


The peers info command returns a peer's profile information. The default
format is yaml.

Using the `--verbose` flag, you can also view a peer's network information.

You must have `qri connect` running in another terminal.

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
-->
```
qri peers info [flags]
```

#### Examples

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
# TODO(dlong): Fix this stub.
-->
```
  show info on a peer named "b5":
  $ qri peers info b5

  show info in json:
  $ qri peers info b5 --format json
```

#### Options

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
# TODO(dlong): Automatically compare against real command-line flags
-->
```
      --format string   output format. formats: yaml, json (default "yaml")
  -h, --help            help for info
  -v, --verbose         show verbose profile info
```



________


## qri peers list

List known qri peers

#### Synopsis


Lists the peers to which your Qri node is connected.

You must have `qri connect` running in another terminal.

To find peers that are not online, but to which your node has previously been
connected, use the `--cached` flag.

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
-->
```
qri peers list [flags]
```

#### Examples

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
# TODO(dlong): Fix this stub.
-->
```
  # spin up a Qri node
  qri connect

  # thenin a separate terminal, to list qri peers:
  qri peers list

  # to ensure you get a cached version of the list:
  qri peers list --cached
```

#### Options

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
# TODO(dlong): Automatically compare against real command-line flags
-->
```
  -c, --cached           show peers that aren't online, but previously seen
  -h, --help             help for list
  -l, --limit int        limit max number of peers to show (default 200)
  -n, --network string   specify network to show peers from [ipfs]
  -s, --offset int       number of peers to skip during listing
```



________


## qri peers

Commands for working with peers

#### Synopsis


The `peers` commands allow you to interact with other peers on the Qri network.
In order for these commands to work, you must be running a Qri node. This
node allows you to communicate on the network. To spin up a Qri node, run
`qri connect` in a separate terminal. This will connect you to the network,
until you choose to close the connection by ending the session or closing
the terminal.

#### Options

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
# TODO(dlong): Automatically compare against real command-line flags
-->
```
  -h, --help   help for peers
```



________


## qri publish

set dataset publicity

#### Synopsis

Publish makes your dataset available to others. While online, peers that connect
to you can only see datasets and versions that you've published. Publishing a
dataset always makes all previous history entries available, and any updates
to a published dataset will be immediately visible to connected peers.


<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
-->
```
qri publish [flags]
```

#### Examples

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
# TODO(dlong): Fix this stub.

________


## qri registry

Commands for working with a qri registry

#### Synopsis


Registries are federated public records of datasets and peers.
These records form a public facing central lookup for your datasets, so others
can find them through search tools and via web links. You can use registry
commands to control how your datasets are published to registries, opting
in or out on a dataset-by-dataset basis.

Unpublished dataset info will be held locally so you can still interact
with it. And your datasets will be available to others peers when you run
"qri connect", but will not show up in search results, and will not be
displayed on lists of registry datasets.

Qri is designed to work without a registry should you want to opt out of
centralized listing entirely, but know that peers who *do* participate in
registries may choose to deprioritize connections with you. Opting out of a
registry entirely is better left to advanced users.

You can opt out of registries entirely by running:
$ qri config set registry.location ""

#### Options

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
# TODO(dlong): Automatically compare against real command-line flags
-->
```
  -h, --help   help for registry
```



________


## qri remove

Remove a dataset from your local repository

#### Synopsis


Remove gets rid of a dataset from your qri node. After running remove, qri will
no longer list your dataset as being available locally. By default, remove frees
up the space taken up by the dataset, but not right away. The IPFS repo that’s
storing the data will need to garbage-collect that data when it’s good & ready,
which could be anytime. If you’re running low on space, garbage collection will
be sooner.

Keep in mind that by default your IPFS repo is capped at 10GB in size, if you
adjust this cap using IPFS, qri will respect it.

In the future we’ll add a flag that’ll force immediate removal of a dataset from
both qri & IPFS. Promise.

<!--

## qri rename

Change the name of a dataset

#### Synopsis


Rename changes the name of a dataset.

Note that if someone has added your dataset to their qri node, and then
you rename your local dataset, your peer's version of your dataset will
not have the updated name. While this won't break anything, it will
confuse anyone who has added your dataset before the change. Try to keep
renames to a minimum.

## qri render

Execute a template against a dataset

#### Synopsis


You can use html templates, formatted in the go/html template style,
to render visualizations from your dataset. These visualizations can be charts,
graphs, or just display your dataset in a different format.

Use the `--output` flag to save the rendered html to a file.

Use the `--template` flag to use a custom template. If no template is
provided, Qri will render the dataset with a default template.

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
-->
```
qri render [flags]
```

#### Examples

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
# TODO(dlong): Fix this stub.

  render a dataset called me/schools:
  $ qri render -o=schools.html me/schools

  render a dataset with a custom template:
  $ qri render --template=template.html me/schools
```

#### Options

<!--

  -l, --limit int         max number of records to read (default 50)
  -s, --offset int        number of records to skip
  -o, --output string     path to write output file
  -t, --template string   path to template file
```



________


## qri save

Save changes to a dataset

#### Synopsis


Save is how you change a dataset, updating one or more of data, metadata, and structure.
You can also update your data via url. Every time you run save, an entry is added to
your dataset’s log (which you can see by running `qri log <dataset_reference>`).

If the dataset you're changing has defined a transform, running `qri save`
will re execute the transform. To only re-run the transform, run save with no args.

Every time you save, you can provide a message about what you changed and why.
If you don’t provide a message Qri will automatically generate one for you.

When you make an update and save a dataset that you originally added from a different
peer, the dataset gets renamed from `peers_name/dataset_name` to `my_name/dataset_name`.

The `--message` and `--title` flags allow you to add a
commit message and title to the save.

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
-->
```
qri save [flags]
```

#### Examples

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
# TODO(dlong): Fix this stub.
-->
```
  # save updated data to dataset annual_pop:
  qri save --body /path/to/data.csv me/annual_pop

  # save updated dataset (no data) to annual_pop:
  qri save --file /path/to/dataset.yaml me/annual_pop

  # re-execute a dataset that has a transform:
  qri save me/tf_dataset
```

#### Options

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
# TODO(dlong): Automatically compare against real command-line flags
-->
```
      --body string       path to file or url of data to add as dataset contents
      --dry-run           simulate saving a dataset
  -f, --file string       dataset data file (yaml or json)
  -h, --help              help for save
  -m, --message string    commit message for save
  -p, --publish           publish this dataset to the registry
      --recall string     restore revisions from dataset history
      --secrets strings   transform secrets as comma separated key,value,key,value,... sequence
  -t, --title string      title of commit message for save

```



________


## qri setup

Initialize qri and IPFS repositories, provision a new qri ID

#### Synopsis


Setup is the first command you run to get a fresh install of Qri. If you’ve
never run qri before, you’ll need to run setup before you can do anything.

Setup does a few things:
- create a qri repository to keep all of your data
- provisions a new qri ID
- create an IPFS repository if one doesn’t exist

This command is automatically run if you invoke any Qri command without first
running setup. If setup has already been run, by default Qri won’t let you
overwrite this info.

Use the `--remove` to remove your Qri repo. This deletes your entire repo,
including all your datasets, and de-registers your peername from the registry.

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
-->
```
qri setup [flags]
```

#### Examples

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
# TODO(dlong): Fix this stub.
-->
```
  run setup with a peername of your choosing:
  $ qri setup --peername=your_great_peername
```

#### Options

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
# TODO(dlong): Automatically compare against real command-line flags
-->
```
  -a, --anonymous            use an auto-generated peername
      --config-data string   json-encoded configuration data, specify a filepath with '@' prefix
  -h, --help                 help for setup
      --init-ipfs            initialize an IPFS repo if one isn't present (default true)
      --ipfs-config string   json-encoded configuration data, specify a filepath with '@' prefix
      --overwrite            overwrite repo if one exists
      --peername string      choose your desired peername
      --registry string      override default registry URL, set to 'none' to remove registry
      --remove               permanently remove qri, overrides all setup options
```



________


## qri update

add/create the lastest version of a dataset

#### Synopsis


Update fast-forwards your dataset to the latest known version. If the dataset
is not in your namespace (i.e. dataset name doesn't start with your peername),
update will ask the peer for any new versions and download them. Updating a peer
dataset accepts no arguments other than the dataset name and --dry-run flag.

**For peer update to work, the peer must be online at the time. We know this is
irritating, we're working on a solution.**

Calling update on a dataset in your namespace will advance your dataset by
re-running any specified transform script, creating a new version of your
dataset in the process. If your dataset doesn't have a transform script, update
will error.

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
-->
```
qri update [flags]
```

#### Examples

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
# TODO(dlong): Fix this stub.
-->
```
  # get the freshest version of a dataset from a peer
  qri update other_person/dataset

  # update your local dataset by re-running the dataset transform
  qri update me/dataset_with_transform

  # supply secrets to an update, publish on successful run
  qri update me/dataset_with_transform -p --secrets=keyboard,cat
```

#### Options

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
# TODO(dlong): Automatically compare against real command-line flags

```
      --dry-run           simulate updating a dataset
  -h, --help              help for update
  -m, --message string    commit message for update
      --recall string     restore revisions from dataset history, only 'tf' applies when updating
      --secrets strings   transform secrets as comma separated key,value,key,value,... sequence
  -t, --title string      title of commit message for update
```



________


## qri use

Select datasets for use with the qri get command

#### Synopsis


Run the `use` command to have Qri remember references to a specific datasets.
These datasets will be referenced for future commands, if no dataset reference
is explicitly given for those commands.

We created this command to ease the typing/copy and pasting burden while using
Qri to explore a dataset.

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
-->
```
qri use [flags]
```

#### Examples

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
# TODO(dlong): Fix this stub.

```
  # use dataset me/dataset_name, then get meta.title:
  qri use me/dataset_name
  qri get meta.title

  # clear current selection:
  qri use --clear

  # show current selected dataset references:
  qri use --list

  # add multiple references to the remembered list
  qri use me/population_2017 me/population_2018
```

#### Options

<!--
docrun:
  pass: true
# TODO(dlong): Automatically compare against real command-line flags

  -l, --list    list selected references
```



________


## qri validate

Show schema validation errors

#### Synopsis


Validate checks data for errors using a schema and then printing a list of
issues. By default validate checks a dataset's body against it’s own schema.
Validate is a flexible command that works with data and schemas either
inside or outside of qri by providing one or both of --body and --schema
arguments.

Providing --schema and --body is an “external validation" that uses nothing
stored in qri. When only one of schema or body args are provided, the other
comes from a dataset reference. For example, to check how a file “data.csv”
validates against a dataset "foo”, we would run:

  $ qri validate --body data.csv me/foo

In this case, qri will will print any validation as if data.csv was foo’s data.

To see how changes to a schema will validate against a
dataset in qri, we would run:

  $ qri validate --schema schema.json me/foo

In this case, qri will print validation errors as if stucture.json was the
schema for dataset "me/foo"

Using validate this way is a great way to see how changes to data or schema
will affect a dataset before saving changes to a dataset.

You can get the current schema of a dataset by running the `qri get structure.schema`
command.

Note: --body and --schema flags will override the dataset if both flags are provided.
