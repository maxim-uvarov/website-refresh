Qri (pronounced "query") is a distributed dataset version control and sharing system.  Our software helps to alleviate many of the pain points of working with datasets.

This page provides an overview of core concepts to understand before getting started with Qri.

## A New Dataset Format

Before learning about Qri's versioning and networking capabilities, you must first understand that Qri's definition of a dataset contains _more than the data itself_.

A major shortcoming of file-based datasets (think CSVs) is that they lack critical context that users need to understand or use them.  Data files are easily portable, but when CSVs are flying around the internet, they are usually detached from their metadata.  They can‚Äôt tell you who changed them last, when that change occurred, and what was changed.  They can‚Äôt describe the background and goals of the person or team that collected and curated the data.

üñº - (I want to show that downloading a CSV from a data portal basically ‚Äúorphans‚Äù the data from all the valuable information on the portal.  (meta, updated at, column descriptions, etc))

Qri's dataset format combines tabular data with all of the things that are missing from normal CSVs.  These include metadata, user identity, column types, validation rules, update scripts, and more.  You can think of this collection as a hybrid dataset.  All of these components live together under a single structure. More importantly, they are all versioned together.

## Qri Versioning

Qri datasets are version-aware.  When you make a change to a dataset, whether it be reformatting values in a column or adding a description to the metadata, you must *commit* the changes and establish a *new version*.

The version has a timestamp, your identity, and a message for future you (or other users you share the dataset with).

## Qri Networking

Qri datasets are easily portable over Qri's peer-to-peer network.  This means that datasets and their version histories can be shared with other Qri users on a local network or published to Qri's cloud platform to share with the world.  

Likewise, once you have Qri running on your computer, you can pull down other Qri users' datasets to view and modify locally.

# Conceptual Model

The three concepts above combine into a distributed ecosystem of datasets.  The qri data format combines raw data with critical supporting data. The version control system tracks changes and identity, and the network allows for decentralized sharing and transfer of datasets.
