The Qri Dataset model includes an optional readme component which allows you to append a free-form text document to your dataset.  Readmes are often used to help new users of a dataset get up to speed on how to use it, and to document caveats and other important context.
Qri Readmes support markdown, meaning you can add things like stylized text, hyperlinks, and images.  Learn more about Markdown

The Qri dataset b5/world_bank_population has a well-structured readme that you can use as a template.  Let’s take a look:

Key Elements

Title and Description - First and foremost, we provide a dataset title and description.  This is more human-readable than the dataset name, so use human-friendly language to give an overall summary of what is contained in the dataset

Source - Describe the origin of the dataset and any key information about where it came from.

Important Notes - This is a bulleted list of notes that may be helpful to other users.  Are there columns that may be misunderstood at first glance? Are there outliers that may raise questions that you already know the answer to?  Share them here

Contact - Let other users know how to get ahold of you if they have questions, feedback, or contributions.  

When you’re all done, commit your new readme to make a new version of the dataset.  Anyone who subscribes to the dataset can now pull in your readme!
