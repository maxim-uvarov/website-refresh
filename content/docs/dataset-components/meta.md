## Overview

The __meta__ component contains human-readable descriptive metadata that qualifies and distinguishes a dataset.

Well-defined meta should aid in making datasets findable by describing a dataset in generalizable taxonomies that can aggregate across other datasets.

Because datasets are intended to interoperate with many other data storage and cataloging systems, meta fields and conventions are derived from existing metadata formats whenever possible.

## Meta in Qri Desktop

You can edit a dataset's meta component in Qri Desktop.  Navigate to the Dataset Pane, then click the meta tab under status.  You can fill out the meta form, and Qri will track your changes.

## Meta in Qri CLI
