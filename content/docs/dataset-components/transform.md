## Overview

The __transform__ component allows users to attach scripting to Qri datasets.  This allowing for automated updates and workflows that combine several datasets into a single output dataset.

Qri transforms are written in [Starlark](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/language.html), a programming language similar in syntax to Python3.
